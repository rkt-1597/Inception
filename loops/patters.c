/*
Print the pattern :
 1 
 1 2
 1 2 3
 1 2 3 4
 1 2 3 4 5

How to do this ?
There are 5 rows in total. So, you need to create a loop that runs 5 times 

In each row:
You will print numbers starting from 1.
The number of numbers you print should match the row number. For example:
In row 1, print only 1.
In row 2, print 1 2.
In row 3, print 1 2 3, and so on.
To do this, create a loop inside another loop.
