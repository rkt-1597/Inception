/*
Checking if a number is a palindrome and if 
it is a palindrome, print the reversed number

Steps :
1. Define variables for original number (orig_num), digit 
of number (digit), reversed number (rev_num) and another 
variable for comparing reversed number with original number
(chk_num)

2. Take an integer from user as input and store it in orig_num

3. Store value of orig_num in chk_num

4. Iterate over each digit of the orig_num, using digit 
and chk_num variables, and form the reversed number rev_num

5. Check if orig_num and rev_num are equal; if yes, print that 
given number is a palindrome; else print that it isn't a palindrome
and print reversed number

    //Define required variables
    int orig_num, digit, rev_num, chk_num;
    
    //Your code below
