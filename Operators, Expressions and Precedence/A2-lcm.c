/*
Finding the LCM of 2 numbers

Steps :
1. Define variables for 2 numbers (a and b) and their LCM (lcm)

2. Take 2 integers from user as input and store them in a and b

3. Store the value of the highest among given 2 numbers, in 'lcm'

4. Iterate infinitely, such that in each iteration, if value of lcm is
divisible by the given 2 numbers, then print the value of lcm and leave 
the loop

int main(){

    //Define required variables
    int a, b, lcm;
    
    //Your code below
    
    
    return 0;
